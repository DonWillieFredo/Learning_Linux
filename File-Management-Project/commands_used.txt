CHMOD(1)                                User Commands                               CHMOD(1)

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode
       bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representa‐
       tion of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the  new
       mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either
       zero  or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Mul‐
       tiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the  file  will  be
       changed:  the  user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users
       not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).  If none of these are given,  the  ef‐
       fect is as if (a) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

       The  operator  +  causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file
       mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and = causes them  to  be  added
       and  causes  unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set
       user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w),
       execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a  direc‐
       tory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on ex‐
       ecution  (s),  restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of
       these letters, you can specify exactly  one  of  the  letters  ugo:  the  permissions
       granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who
       are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in
       neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A  numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits
       with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The  first
       digit  selects  the  set  user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or
       sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the  user  who  owns
       the  file:  read  (4),  write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for
       other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users
       not in the file's group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system  call  cannot
       change  their  permissions.   This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic
       links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on  the  command  line,
       chmod  changes  the  permissions  of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores
       symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID  does  not
       match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, un‐
       less the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-
       user-ID  and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends
       on the policy and functionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When in  doubt,
       check the underlying system behavior.

       For  directories chmod preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explic‐
       itly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes  like  u+s
       and  g-s.   To clear these bits for directories with a numeric mode requires an addi‐
       tional leading zero like 00755, leading minus like  -6000,  or  leading  equals  like
       =755.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The  restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation de‐
       pends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from  remov‐
       ing  or  renaming  a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory;
       this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly  found
       on  world-writable  directories  like /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems,
       the bit saves the program's text image on the  swap  device  so  it  will  load  more
       quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE
       to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use  RFILE's mode instead of specifying MODE values.  RFILE is always derefer‐
              enced if a symbolic link.

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.

       -1     list one file per line

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  SIZE  argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units
       are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary  pre‐
       fixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       The  TIME_STYLE  argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT
       is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,  then  FORMAT1
       applies  to  non-recent  files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with
       'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE environment
       variable sets the default style to use.

       The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can also be 'auto' or 'never'.

       Using color  to  distinguish  file  types  is  disabled  both  by  default  and  with
       --color=never.   With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard output is
       connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.
       Use the dircolors(1) command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually supersedes the ver‐
       sion described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation  for  details  about
       the options it supports.

       NOTE: printf(1) is a preferred alternative, which does not have issues outputting op‐
       tion-like strings.
